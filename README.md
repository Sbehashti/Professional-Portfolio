# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

This is a further demonstartion of my abilities with HTML and CSS, including familiarities with more Advanced CSS including media queries. Using these applications, I created a portfolio page that will demonstrate examplkes of my work, as well as information about myself to any and all potential employers for future career opportunities. It was designed in a way to create opportunities for expansion and improvemnts as more of my projects are added and was designed to be accessible to both large and small screens.
